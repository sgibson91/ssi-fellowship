4,I don't know about Project Binder,5.0,5.0,5.0,,Easily share work with someone else today,1.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,No,This is actually a big problem for publications - the main code I use is not open source and so now many model development journals are not accepting publications because the code is not available. If I could publish it would be with the paper.,,,,"Code is not owned by my organisation and it's not open source, we use it under license. This is a big issue at the moment. We are actively making our code open source at the moment.",Sometimes,No,I'm not sure what use case I have for using Binder,"vagrant, ansible, conda",,Never,Interface between the things I can script and the things from the closed code that needs more user inputs.,entering credentials,,,
