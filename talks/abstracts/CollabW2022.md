## Mini-workshop or demo session title

Crowdsourcing Community Practices for Defining Reproducible Computational Environments in the Cloud

## Mini-workshop or demo session abstract

_If your session is accepted this abstract will be made public on the CW22 website, so please write this as a public description containing 200-400 words._

_Current word count: 230_

mybinder.org is a very popular tool for hosting interactive and reproducible computational environments in the cloud.
The ethos of this project, and those that power it, is _"to automate existing community best practices. If a community isn't doing something in the way we think they are, we shouldn't implement what we think."_
While Binder supports a range of languages across the open source software ecosystem (and beyond!), Binder itself is primarily a Python package that is maintained by Python developers.
And so keeping up to date with other communities and ensuring the project doesn't fall too far behind in terms of best practice is a large effort that often happens outside of the maintainer's network.

For this mini-workshop, we would like to invite a diverse range of people working across various languages to participate in an interactive survey pilot and facilitated discussion around the best practices they currently use for defining reproducible computational environments.
The aim of the session will be to better understand the pain points of using a service like Binder, and how Binder's assumptions may or may not be mismatched with various community best practices.
We hope to build strong connections with active users across communities to provide specific and useful feedback to the Binder team.

Everyone is welcome to attend this mini-workshop even if you don't use Binder or have never heard of it before now!

- [x] Other: _(please describe)_

Community best practices, information gathering

## Mini-workshop or demo session length

_Please choose your preferred session length. We expect 30-minute sessions to be more suitable for demonstrations or presentations, and 60-minute sessions to facilitate participant interaction._

- [ ] 30 minutes
- [x] 60 minutes

## Mini-workshop or demo session description

_Please describe your session's aims and outcomes, and how the session connects to the themes of CW22. If you are proposing a 60-minute session, please outline how you plan to facilitate participant interaction._

- Use the responses to this interactive survey and facilitated discussions to better understand areas of improvement in the Binder ecosystem; for example, user pain points, where community best practices do not align with Binder's expectations, and so on.
- Generate specific and useful feedback to the Binder core team to support the user community
- Build a stronger connections with active folk in these communities, invite them to further discussions with members of the Binder core team
- This session will be an interactive survey including live visualisations of responses powered by Mentimeter
  We will also host facilitated discussions for each set of responses, capturing insight in a shared document.
- We aim to use this mini-workshop as a pilot to reflect upon and receive feedback on how the survey itself could be improved and reformatted for distribution to a wider audience.

## Any special requirements, prerequisites for participants or other information you would like to include about your proposed session?

We will most likely use break-out rooms to be able to facilitate discussion between group with different experience/knowledge of mybinder.org, and so having host capabilities to organise those break-out rooms would be beneficial to the facilitators.
