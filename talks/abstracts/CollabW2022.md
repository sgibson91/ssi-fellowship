As the scale of data-intensive research grows ever larger, various scientific domains are experiencing a shift towards cloud-based workflows.
This brings with it a need to reliably and reproducibly define a computational environment that can be transported between local and cloud systems.
Many tools providing this service already exist and they broadly fall into two camps: provide a “kitchen-sink” environment with many of the data-science tools a researcher would expect to have preinstalled; or enable bespoke, analysis-specific environments to be built on the fly.
For those tools in the second camp, understanding how various domains working across a range of programming languages expect to define their environments is critical to the success of the tool.
If these expectations do not align with the best practices of a community, that community often stops using this tool and may go as far as to begin to develop their own, bespoke solution.
This breaks the ethos that open science is built upon: that sharing knowledge, interoperable tools, and decentralised infrastructure can accelerate the progress of research since work is no longer repeated in siloes.

However, the broader the range of communities you aim to support, the broader the range of usage patterns and best practices becomes.
Simply keeping up to date and not lagging too far behind is in itself a huge undertaking.
And while a tool may be interoperable and support other languages, the tool itself is still a codebase in a given language and hence a scenario develops where the maintainers of the tool are not experts in all the communities they support.
To begin to address these concerns, we need to open a dialogue with communities and collect feedback to guide development and identify awareness gaps in how the tool is being used and is expected to work.

For this mini-workshop, we would like to invite a diverse range of people working across various languages to participate in an interactive survey pilot and facilitated discussion around the best practices they currently use for defining reproducible computational environments.
The aim of the session will be to better understand the pain points of using a cloud-based environment service, and how the assumptions such a service makes may or may not align with various community best practices.
As a popular tool in this area, we will be using mybinder.org as an example of such a service, though prior knowledge is not a requirement, and we hope to build strong connections with active users across communities to provide specific and useful feedback to the Binder team.

## Mini-workshop of demo session theme(s)

_Which of the CW22 themes does your mini-workshop or demo session fit into? (Select all that apply.)_

- [ ] Code Review
- [ ] Ethics
- [ ] Hybrid Working
- [ ] Software Sustainability
- [x] Other: _(please describe)_

Community best practices, information gathering

## Mini-workshop or demo session length

_Please choose your preferred session length. We expect 30-minute sessions to be more suitable for demonstrations or presentations, and 60-minute sessions to facilitate participant interaction._

- [ ] 30 minutes
- [x] 60 minutes

## Mini-workshop or demo session description

_Please describe your session's aims and outcomes, and how the session connects to the themes of CW22. If you are proposing a 60-minute session, please outline how you plan to facilitate participant interaction._

- The responses to this interactive survey and facilitated discussions will provide better understanding of areas of improvement in the Binder ecosystem; for example, user pain points, where community best practices do not align with Binder's expectations, and so on.
- We aim to generate specific and useful feedback to the Binder core team to support the user community
- We aim to build stronger connections with active folk in these communities, and invite them to further discussions with members of the Binder core team
- This session will be an interactive survey including live visualisations of responses powered by Mentimeter.
  We will also host facilitated discussions for each set of responses, capturing insight in a shared document.
- We also aim to use this mini-workshop as a pilot to reflect upon and receive feedback on how the survey itself could be improved and reformatted for distribution to a wider audience.

## Any special requirements, prerequisites for participants or other information you would like to include about your proposed session?

We will most likely use break-out rooms to be able to facilitate discussion between group with different experience/knowledge of mybinder.org, and so having host capabilities to organise those break-out rooms would be beneficial to the facilitators.
