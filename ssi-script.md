#### Slide 1

Hi!
My name is Sarah Gibson and welcome to my 2020 SSI Fellowship application.

#### Slide 2

Here's a little bit about me.

I'm a Research Data Scientist at The Alan Turing Institute.

I'm part of a team that shares thousands of Jupyter notebooks everyday using mybinder.org, maintained by Project Binder.

I am part of the core development team that launched _The Turing Way_. I contributions there and share my knowledge so other institutions can offer similar services.

#### Slide 3

Through the SSI Fellowship, I want to share my Binder experience and grow the community to a thriving ecosystem of computation and research with notebooks.
Specifically, I'd like to find new contributors with different skillsets so we can diversify Binder's capababilities, and new maintainers so we can increase Binder's bus factor and longevity as a project.

#### Slide 4

As a data scientist, a large part of my job is building analysis pipelines.
These need to be reproducible and reusable for when the project is handed over to the clients.

_The Turing Way_ is a handbook for reproducible data science and collates together software tooling and best practices that makes this "too easy not to do"!
I was particularly involved with incorporating Binder into the book.

Through my contributions via _The Turing Way_, I was asked to officially join the Binder team where I share my experience through outreach and improve the Binder experience through development.

#### Slide 5

From these experiences, I have developed some core values: the first of which is _reproducibility_.
I strongly believe that the minimum bar for a project should be that the same data and analysis pipeline consistently produce the same results.

#### Slide 6

My next value is openness.
Whether this is open science or open software, I believe building this kind of community with free exchanges of ideas can drive creative and scientific progress.

#### Slide 7

And lastly, I'm passionate about how Software Engineering can facilitate these values through well-designed user-focused tooling and best practices.

#### Slide 8

So what's this Binder project I'm so excited about?

#### Slide 9

mybinder.org is a free-to-use website that allows a code repository to be run in the cloud and easily shared via a single, clickable link.
It achieves this by capturing a documented software environment from a public repository.

#### Slide 10

BinderHub is the computational infrastructure that underpins mybinder.org and collects together different tools, including JupyterHub and Kubernetes.

#### Slide 11

mybinder.org is a federated project, meaning that it is not hosted by a single team.
The original Hub is hosted on Google Cloud in the US and a second Hub is hosted on OVH in Europe.

#### Slide 12

The Turing also has a plan to join the federation and host a Hub on Azure.
Stay tuned!

#### Slide 13

How have I contributed so far?

Through _The Turing Way_, I ran workshops that helped people make Binders out of their own projects.
I have also helped more people than ever deploy their own BinderHubs and developed a one-click deploy button.

At this year's RSE Conference, I was invited to speak about collaborating with the Binder team on the RSE Worldwide panel, as well as running my BinderHub workshop.

#### Slide 14

What challenges do the Binder community face?

The development team are very Python-centric which makes it tricky to help users with other languages or develop Binder into that space.

The team is also quite small with few people knowing how to maintain the project, which can slow down development.

#### Slide 15

Why should someone be interested in joining the Binder community?

They would have a voice in shaping the roadmap of the project and also help improve support for their language or domain.

Not forgetting the opportunity to work with wonderful, supportive people!

#### Slide 16

For the SSI Fellowship, I have identified 4 conferences I would like to attend as a Binder advocate.
The Fellowship should cover the cost of at least three.

These are:

- European R Users Meeting to reach the R community;
- EuroSciPy to reach scientific users;
- JuliaCon to reach the Julia community (provided its hosted in UK/EU);
- and potentially PyCon UK.

There may also be some scope for visiting user Meetup groups in the UK.

#### Slide 17

My aims for these conferences would be to:

- give talks advocating for Binder;
- run hands-on workshops on using Binder with languages other than Python;
- or using sprint sessions to facilitate first contributions to Binder, in the spirit of _The Turing Way_ Book Dashes and Collaboration Cafes.

#### Slide 18

Thank you for listening to my presentation, and I hope I've inspired you to try out mybinder.org.
