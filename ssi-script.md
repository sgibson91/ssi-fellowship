#### Slide 1

Hi!
My name is Sarah Gibson and welcome to my 2020 SSI Fellowship application.

#### Slide 2

Here's a little bit about me.

I'm a Research Data Scientist at The Alan Turing Institute.
The Turing is the UK's national institute for Data Science and AI.
My role involves applying new data science techniques to real-world problems and turning these tools into software for others to use.

I'm part of the Project Binder team that runs mybinder.org.
We help people share thousands of Jupyter notebooks everyday.
I share my experience of Binder through outreach and improve the Binder experience through development.

I am part of the core development team that launched _The Turing Way_.
This is a handbook for reproducible data science and we collate together software tooling and best practices that make this "too easy not to do"!
I contribute to the handbook and events so that I can share my knowledge and support other institutions in offering similar services.

#### Slide 3

Through the SSI Fellowship, I want to share my Binder experience and grow the community to a thriving ecosystem of computation and research with notebooks.
Specifically, I'd like to find new contributors with different skillsets so we can diversify Binder's capabilities, and new maintainers so we can increase Binder's bus factor and longevity as a project.
I'd like to achieve this through running a workshop on contributing to Project Binder and attending events in different communities.

#### Slide 4

So what's this Binder project I'm so excited about?

#### Slide 5

mybinder.org is a free-to-use website that allows a code repository to be run in the cloud and easily shared via a single, clickable link.
Three ingredients are needed for Binder, which are: code or notebooks in one of many supported languages, these should be published in a public repository and accompanied by documented software dependencies.
This allows mybinder.org to serve the notebooks to anyone over the cloud.

#### Slide 6

BinderHub is the computational infrastructure that powers mybinder.org and collects together different tools, including JupyterHub and Kubernetes.
This is an open source project that is free for anyone to deploy in their own institutions.

#### Slide 7

mybinder.org is a federated project, meaning that it is not hosted by a single team.
The original Hub is hosted on Google Cloud in the US and a second Hub is hosted on OVH in Europe.

#### Slide 8

As well as maintaining the Google cluster, I have also won a proposal to host a third Hub at the Turing on Azure.
Stay tuned!

#### Slide 9

How have I contributed to Binder so far?

Through _The Turing Way_, I ran workshops that helped people make Binders out of their own projects.
I have also helped more people than ever deploy their own BinderHubs and developed a one-click deploy button.

At this year's RSE Conference, I was invited to speak about collaborating with the Binder team on the RSE Worldwide panel, as well as running my "Build A BinderHub" workshop.

#### Slide 10

What challenges do the Binder community face?

The development team are very Python-centric which makes it tricky to help users with other languages or develop Binder into that space.

The team is also quite small with few people knowing how to maintain the project, which can slow down development.

I want to bring more people into the Binder community because:

They would have a voice in shaping the roadmap of the project and also help improve support for their language or domain.

Not forgetting the opportunity to work with wonderful, supportive people!

#### Slide 11

Through the SSI Fellowship I'd like to host a Binder "Do-athon".
This would be a single day workshop split into two sessions.
In the morning session, I'd teach the attendees how to use Binder for a their own projects.
Then in the afternoon, I'd invite them to make a small contribution back to Project Binder around an aspect they may have found tricky.

I'd like to make use of my connections in _The Turing Way_ community to help fund and advertise this event.

I'm calling this event a "do-athon" as a I want to encourage non-code contributions.

#### Slide 12

I have also identified three conferences I would like to attend as a Binder advocate.
The Fellowship should cover the cost of at least a couple of them.

These are:

- European R Users Meeting to reach the R community;
- EuroSciPy to reach scientific users; and
- JuliaCon to reach the Julia community.

My aims for these conferences would be to:

- give talks advocating for Binder;
- run hands-on workshops on using Binder with languages other than Python;
- or using sprint sessions to facilitate first contributions to Binder, in the spirit of _The Turing Way_ Book Dashes and Collaboration Cafes.

#### Slide 13

Thank you for listening to my presentation, and I hope I've inspired you to try out mybinder.org.
