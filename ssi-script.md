#### Slide 1

Hi!
My name is Sarah Gibson and I'm really excited to present my 2020 SSI Fellowship application.

#### Slide 2

Let me start with a little bit about myself.

When I'm not rocking out onstage at festivals, I'm a Research Data Scientist at The Alan Turing Institute.
The Turing is the UK's national institute for Data Science and AI.
My role involves applying new data science techniques to real-world problems and turning these tools into software for others to use.

#### Slide 3

I'm very proud to be part of the Project Binder team that runs mybinder.org.
We help people share thousands of Jupyter notebooks everyday.
I share my experience of Binder through outreach and improve the Binder experience through development.
Normally I collaborate remotely with this team, but we were lucky to work together in person in Oslo a couple of months ago.

#### Slide 4

I am part of the core development team that launched _The Turing Way_.
This is a handbook for reproducible data science and we collate together software tooling and best practices that make this "too easy not to do"!
I contribute to the handbook and events so that I can share my knowledge and support other institutions in offering similar services.

#### Slide 5

Through the SSI Fellowship, I want to share my Binder experience and grow the community to a thriving ecosystem of computation and research with notebooks.
Specifically, I'd like to find new contributors with different skillsets so we can diversify Binder's capabilities, and new maintainers so we can increase Binder's bus factor and longevity as a project.
I'd like to achieve this through running a workshop on contributing to Binder and attending events in different communities.

If you're not familiar with the bus factor for software engineering, it's a tongue-in-cheek measure of how resilient a project is to a community member no longer being able to contribute.
As if they've been hit by a bus!

#### Slide 6

So what's this Binder project I'm so excited about?

#### Slide 7

mybinder.org is a free-to-use website that allows a code repository to be run in the cloud and easily shared via a single, clickable link.
Three ingredients are needed for Binder, which are:

#### Slide 8

code or notebooks in one of many supported languages,

#### Slide 9

that are published in a public repository,

#### Slide 10

and are accompanied by documented software dependencies.

#### Slide 11

This allows mybinder.org to serve the notebooks to anyone over the cloud.

#### Slide 12

BinderHub is the computational infrastructure that powers mybinder.org and orchestrates a range of technologies, including JupyterHub and Kubernetes.
This is an open source project that is free for anyone to deploy in their own institutions.

When I first began working with BinderHub, I found the number of interacting technologies involved overwhelming.
So during _The Turing Way_ Book Dashes, I sat down with a live illustrator to create this image of the BinderHub ecosystem to help clarify and visualise how these tools work together.
I'd like to use the network the Fellowship will provide me with to find new and different pathways to lower the barrier to working with BinderHub.

#### Slide 13

mybinder.org is a federated project, meaning that it is not hosted by a single team.
The original Hub is hosted on Google Cloud in the US and a second Hub is hosted on OVH in Europe.

#### Slide 14

As well as maintaining the Google cluster, I have also won a proposal for $10k to host a third Hub at the Turing on Azure.
Not only will this strengthen mybinder.org as a project, but it strengthens the Turing's reputation as an investor in open source projects and a leader in reproducible data science.

#### Slide 14

How have I contributed to Binder so far?

Through _The Turing Way_, I developed and ran successful workshops that helped people make Binders out of their own projects and deploy BinderHubs.

My work with BinderHub on Azure meant I was able to develop a one-click button that reduces the complexity of the deployment process.

And at this year's RSE Conference, I was invited to speak about collaborating with the Binder team on the RSE Worldwide panel, as well as running my "Zero to BinderHub" workshop.

#### Slide 16

I absolutely love being a member of the Binder community, but nothing can be perfect and we face our own issues.

#### Slide 17

Binder is part of the Jupyter ecosystem.
Despite Jupyter standing for Julia, Python and R, the development team are very Python-centric.
So two thirds of our named supported community are not well represented among the team.
This makes it tricky to help users with those languages or develop Binder into that space.

#### Slide 18

The team is also quite small with few people knowing how to maintain the project, which can slow down development.
This is the impact that a small bus factor can have on a project.

The benefits a person will receive by joining the Binder community are:

#### Slide 19

Having a voice in shaping the roadmap of the project...

#### Slide 20

and helping improve support for their own language or domain.

#### Slide 21

I also hope to share the experience that I get from this community, which is working with wonderful, supportive people!

#### Slide 22

Through the SSI Fellowship I'd like to host a Binder "Do-athon".
This would be a single day workshop split into two sessions.

#### Slide 23

The morning session would be a "Train the Trainers" style curriculum on integrating Binder with existing teaching materials.

#### Slide 24

Then in the afternoon, I'd invite attendees to make a small contribution back to Binder around barriers they experienced or foresee.

I'd like to make use of my connections in _The Turing Way_ community and the Turing Institute to help fund and advertise this event.

I'm calling this event a "do-athon" since it encourages contributions of all types, such as code, documentation, design, and training.

#### Slide 25

I have also identified three conferences I would like to attend as a Binder advocate.
The Fellowship should cover the cost of at least a couple of them.

These are:

- European R Users Meeting to reach the R community;
- JuliaCon to reach the Julia community; and
- EuroSciPy to reach scientific users.

My aims for these conferences would be to:

- run hands-on workshops using Binder with Python, R and Julia;
- using sprint sessions to facilitate first contributions to Binder, in the spirit of _The Turing Way_ Book Dashes and Collaboration Cafes; and
- Listen and empower these communities to report or contribute their hopes and dreams for Binder.

#### Slide 26

Thank you for listening to my presentation, I'm really excited to be a part of the SSI community.
If you'd like to see more from me, please check out my GitHub and Twitter profiles, and I hope I've inspired you to support mybinder.org.
